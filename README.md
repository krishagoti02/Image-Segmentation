**Object Detection and Counting via Image Segmentation**

**Overview**
This project implements object detection and counting in images using various image segmentation methods. These methods include thresholding segmentation, edge-based segmentation, and region segmentation.

**Objective**
To count the number of object instances in images by leveraging image segmentation techniques.

**Steps Applied**
1. Image Selection and Conversion: Convert selected images to grayscale.
2. Gamma Correction: Apply for image clarity.
3. Threshold Segmentation: Use local adaptive thresholding for image processing.
4. Erosion and Dilation: Connect nearest regions to form distinct objects.
5. Labeling and Counting: Label the image and calculate the object count.
